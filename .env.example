# Environment Configuration Example
# Copy this file to .env and fill in the values

# JWT Secret (REQUIRED)
# This secret is used to sign and verify JWT tokens for authentication.
# CRITICAL: The application will NOT start without this variable set.
#
# Security Requirements:
# - Must be a strong, random string (minimum 32 characters recommended)
# - NEVER commit the actual .env file to version control
# - Use different secrets for development, staging, and production
# - Rotate this secret periodically in production
#
# To generate a secure secret, use one of these commands:
#   openssl rand -hex 32
#   openssl rand -base64 32
#   python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
#
# Example (DO NOT USE THIS - generate your own):
#   JWT_SECRET=your-secure-random-secret-here
JWT_SECRET=

# Database Configuration (if needed)
# DATABASE_URL=file:./poc-finance.db

# Server Configuration (if needed)
# PORT=8080
# HOST=localhost
